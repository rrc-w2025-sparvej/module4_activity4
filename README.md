## Additional Information

The following Module 4 components were implemented in this activity:

- Event Handling- I created methods that handle specific user interactions and update the interface dynamically.  
- Signals- I utilized signals to emit events when certain actions occurred, allowing for a decoupled architecture.
- Slots- I defined slots to handle the emitted signals and perform the necessary actions in response.
- PySide6- I used the PySide6 library to create the GUI components and manage the application window.
